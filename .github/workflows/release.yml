    - name: Upgrade npm for OIDC support 📦
      # Upgrade npm to support OIDC trusted publishing. Earlier steps run with the
      # npm version bundled with current Node version to maintain consistency with
      # the development environment. Only the Publish step requires the newer version.
      # See https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers
      # > Note: Trusted publishing requires npm CLI version 11.5.1 or later.
      # TODO: This can be removed once we upgrade to Node 24 or greater.
      run: npm install -g npm@^11.5.1
