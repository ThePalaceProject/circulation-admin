# Jest Unit Tests

This directory contains unit tests that run using jest. The directory structure should mirror that of the `src` tree.

To run these tests, use the command `npm run test-jest`. These tests are executed along with the older mocha-based tests when `npm test` is run.
To run a single test file, use the command `npm run test-jest-file [filename]`.
